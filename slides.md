Control - Object Detection
==========================

Why is Object Detection Needed?
-------------------------------

At this point the robotic arm system is ready for use, however it is unable to detect its environment.
The system having the ability to detect its environment will aid it in many ways:
- It can determine if the user is looking at an object, the table surface or elsewhere.
- It can determine if a less direct route is required for moving to avoid an object.
- It can help self calibrate the arm position.

There are many different systems that implement this. For example, the method shown uses an array of infra-red emitters and cameras which can detect the position in 3D of reflective balls attached to the quadcopters.

Why use Kinect?
---------------

However, these systems are very expensive and are not ideal for use in this system.

A more affordable 3D vision system is the Xbox Kinect sensor which was released in 2010 for around Â£100.
