Control - Object Detection
==========================

Why is Object Detection Needed?
--------------------------

At this point the robotic arm system is ready for use, however it is unable to detect its environment.
The system having the ability to detect its environment will aid it in many ways:
- It can determine if the user is looking at an object, the table surface or elsewhere.
- It can determine if a less direct route is required for moving to avoid an object.
- It can self calibrate the arm position.

This detection of the environment can be achieved by using object detection.
