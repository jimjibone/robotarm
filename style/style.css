	Now, when we have all the steps styled let's give users a hint how to navigate
	around the presentation.

	The best way to do this would be to use JavaScript, show a delayed hint for a
	first time users, then hide it and store a status in cookie or localStorage...

	But I wanted to have some CSS fun and avoid additional scripting...

	Let me explain it first, so maybe the transition magic will be more readable
	when you read the code.

	First of all I wanted the hint to appear only when user is idle for a while.
	You can't detect the 'idle' state in CSS, but I delayed a appearing of the
	hint by 5s using transition-delay.

	You also can't detect in CSS if the user is a first-time visitor, so I had to
	make an assumption that I'll only show the hint on the first step. And when
	the step is changed hide the hint, because I can assume that user already
	knows how to navigate.

	To summarize it - hint is shown when the user is on the first step for longer
	than 5 seconds.

	The other problem I had was caused by the fact that I wanted the hint to fade
	in and out. It can be easily achieved by transitioning the opacity property.
	But that also meant that the hint was always on the screen, even if totally
	transparent. It covered part of the screen and you couldn't correctly clicked
	through it.
	Unfortunately you cannot transition between display `block` and `none` in pure
	CSS, so I needed a way to not only fade out the hint but also move it out of
	the screen.

	I solved this problem by positioning the hint below the bottom of the screen
	with CSS transform and moving it up to show it. But I also didn't want this move
	to be visible. I wanted the hint only to fade in and out visually, so I delayed
	the fade in transition, so it starts when the hint is already in its correct
	position on the screen.

	I know, it sounds complicated ... maybe it would be easier with the code?

	And as the last thing there is a workaround for quite strange bug.
	It happens a lot in Chrome. I don't remember if I've seen it in Firefox.

	Sometimes the element positioned in 3D (especially when it's moved back
	along Z axis) is not clickable, because it falls 'behind' the <body>
	element.

	To prevent this, I decided to make <body> non clickable by setting
	pointer-events property to `none` value.
	Value if this property is inherited, so to make everything else clickable
	I bring it back on the #impress element.

	If you want to know more about `pointer-events` here are some docs:
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events

	There is one very important thing to notice about this workaround - it makes
	everything 'unclickable' except what's in #impress element.

	So use it wisely ... or don't use at all.

	There is one funny thing I just realized.

	Thanks to this workaround above everything except #impress element is invisible
	for click events. That means that the hint element is also not clickable.
	So basically all of this transforms and delayed transitions trickery was probably
	not needed at all...

	But it was fun to learn about it, wasn't it?
